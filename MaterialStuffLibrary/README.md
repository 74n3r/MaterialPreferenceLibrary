MaterialStuffLibrary
====================

This library is based on some other libraries, to support the next features:

 - alert dialogs, with a similar style of Material-Design.
 - PreferenceActivity, with support of an ActionBar (which is actually a toolbar that looks like an ActionBar)
 
I made it since the current version of the support library doesn't have any of those things.

Thanks

The project consists of some libraries and websites I've looked at :
 - AlertDialogPro (for the alert dialogs):
 https://github.com/fengdai/AlertDialogPro
 - ActionBarSherlock (for the shadow below the action bar) :
 http://actionbarsherlock.com/
 - Some code I got from my own app:

 - The support library of Google, of course:
